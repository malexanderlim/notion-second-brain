# Google OAuth Integration Tasks

This document tracks the tasks required to implement Google OAuth for the Notion Second Brain application, as outlined in `design/GOOGLE_OAUTH_TDD.md`.

## Backend (FastAPI)

### Setup & Configuration
- [x] Add `Authlib` and `itsdangerous` (for Starlette sessions) to `api/requirements.txt`.
- [x] Install new dependencies in the virtual environment.
- [x] Add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`, `AUTHORIZED_USER_EMAIL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `FRONTEND_LOGOUT_URL` to `.env.example`.
- [x] Add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`, `AUTHORIZED_USER_EMAIL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `FRONTEND_LOGOUT_URL` to local `.env` file with actual values.
- [x] Configure these environment variables in Vercel project settings.

### Core OAuth Logic
- [x] Initialize `Authlib` OAuth client for Google in the FastAPI application (in `api/main.py` or `api/auth.py`).
- [x] Implement `GET /api/auth/login/google` endpoint to redirect to Google's OAuth consent screen.
- [x] Implement `GET /api/auth/callback/google` endpoint to:
    - [x] Handle the callback from Google.
    - [x] Exchange authorization code for tokens.
    - [x] Fetch user profile (email, name).
    - [x] Validate authenticated user's email against the `AUTHORIZED_USER_EMAIL` environment variable. Deny access if no match or if `AUTHORIZED_USER_EMAIL` is not set.
    - [x] Store user information in the session if authorized.
    - [x] Redirect to frontend (`FRONTEND_URL`).

### Session Management & User Info
- [x] Add Starlette's `SessionMiddleware` to the FastAPI app.
- [x] Configure session cookie (HTTPOnly, Secure in production, SameSite).
- [x] Implement `GET /api/auth/me` endpoint to return authenticated user data from session.
- [x] Implement `POST /api/auth/logout` endpoint to clear the session and redirect (to `FRONTEND_LOGOUT_URL`).

### Protecting API Routes
- [x] Create a FastAPI dependency function to check for a valid user session.
- [x] Apply the authentication dependency to all existing data-sensitive API routes (`/api/query`, `/api/last-updated`, `/api/transcribe`).

## Frontend (React/TypeScript)

### Authentication State & Context
- [x] Create an `AuthContext` to manage authentication state (`isAuthenticated`, `user`, `isLoading`).
- [x] Implement logic in `AuthProvider` to call `/api/auth/me` on load to initialize auth state.

### Frontend Routing Setup (react-router-dom)
- [x] Install `react-router-dom` and its type definitions.
- [x] Wrap the application with `BrowserRouter` in `frontend/src/main.tsx`.
- [x] Refactor `frontend/src/App.tsx` to define routes and handle protected routing logic.

### Login Page & Components
- [x] Create `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`.
    - [x] Display a "Login with Google" button.
    - [x] Style the login button.
    - [x] On click, redirect to `/api/auth/login/google`.
- [x] `App.tsx` handles protected route logic using `useAuth()` hook.

### Main Application UI (Authenticated View)
- [x] Create `frontend/src/components/layout/MainAppLayout.tsx`.
    - [x] This component is rendered by `App.tsx` for authenticated users.
    - [x] Contains the existing query UI, results display, etc.
- [x] Create `frontend/src/components/auth/LogoutButton.tsx`.
    - [x] Display a "Logout" button.
    - [x] On click, makes a POST request to `/api/auth/logout`.

### Conditional UI Updates
- [x] `App.tsx` uses `isLoading` from `useAuth()` for a global loading state.
- [x] Redirects for login/logout are handled by backend and frontend logic.

## Testing & Deployment

- [x] Manually test the end-to-end login and logout flow locally.
- [x] Test accessing protected resources before and after login.
- [x/Примечание] Test with an incorrect/unauthorized Google account to ensure access is denied based on `AUTHORIZED_USER_EMAIL`. (Note: User confirmed this works as expected with correct email; backend logic should prevent unauthorized access)
- [x/Примечание] Test behavior if `AUTHORIZED_USER_EMAIL` is not set (should deny access). (Note: Backend logic is designed to deny if not set)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel.
- [ ] Test the full authentication flow on the Vercel deployment.
- [ ] Verify environment variables are correctly set and used in Vercel.

## Documentation

- [x] Update `README.md` with instructions for OAuth setup (env variables including `AUTHORIZED_USER_EMAIL`, Google Cloud Console URI config).
- [x] Update `RAG_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` and other relevant docs to reflect that the backend is in the `api/` directory, not `backend/`. (Partially done for RAG overview, will complete now)
- [x] Update `design/GOOGLE_OAUTH_TDD.md` status to `Implemented` upon completion.
